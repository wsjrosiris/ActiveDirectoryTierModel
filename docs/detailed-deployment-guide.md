# Detailed Deployment Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step deployment workflow using scoped deployment parameters. Use this approach when you need granular control over the deployment process or want to deploy components incrementally.

For a streamlined full deployment workflow, see the [Quick Deployment Guide](quick-deployment-guide.md).

> **Supported environment:** English (`en-US`) only — the **host OS** (the machine you run the scripts from) and **Active Directory** must both be English. Non-English environments are detected and stopped during prerequisite validation. See [Language Support](language-support.md).

## Overview

This detailed approach deploys Tier Model components one type at a time, following the proper dependency order:

1. **Organizational Units (OUs)** - Foundation hierarchy
2. **Security Groups** - Required for ACL delegations and GPO filtering
3. **User Accounts** - Service accounts and administrative users
4. **OU ACL Delegations** - Permissions and rights delegation
5. **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** - Policy configuration and linking
6. **ADMX Templates** - Administrative template imports

Each component follows a three-step pattern:
1. **Plan** - Preview changes without applying them
2. **Deploy** - Execute the deployment with `-ConfirmApply`
3. **Audit** - Verify compliance and detect drift

## Step 1: Deploy Organizational Units

### 1.1 Plan OU Deployment
Review what OUs will be created:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -OuOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- List of OUs to be created

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -OuOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

**Expected Output:**
- OUs created successfully
- Protection from accidental deletion applied
- Deployment summary

### 1.3 Audit OUs

## Step 7: Deploy MSA ACL Delegations (Optional)

This step is optional and only required if you need to manage Managed Service Account (MSA) permissions using the Tier Model. Enable with `-IncludeMsa` switch.

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeMsa -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- List of MSAs receiving ACL delegations

- No changes applied to Active Directory

### 7.2 Deploy MSA ACLs
Execute the MSA ACL delegation deployment:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeMsa -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

---

## Step 8: Deploy gMSA ACL Delegations (Optional)

This step is optional and only required if you need to manage Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) permissions using the Tier Model. Enable with `-IncludeGmsa` switch.

### 8.1 Plan gMSA ACL Deployment

## Step 9: Deploy dMSA ACL Delegations (Optional)

- Groups granted appropriate permissions on dMSA objects
- Deployment summary

### 9.3 Audit dMSA ACLs

## Step 10: Deploy Windows LAPS ACL Delegations (Optional)

This step is optional and only required if you use Windows LAPS encrypted-password storage. It deploys 7 ACL delegations (Self, Read, and Reset permissions per target OU) **and** sets the `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` registry value on the 6 non-DC LAPS GPOs so the correct tier group can decrypt managed passwords. Enable with `-IncludeWinLaps` switch.

> ⚠️ **Windows LAPS only** — this feature exclusively uses the Windows LAPS APIs (`ms-LAPS-*` attributes). Legacy Microsoft LAPS (`ms-Mcs-AdmPwd*`, `AdmPwd.PS`) is never referenced or modified.

### Prerequisites

Before running this step, the following must already exist in Active Directory:

| Dependency | Required by |
|-----------|-------------|
| All Tier Model OUs | ACL delegation targets |
| All Tier Model Groups | Read/Reset permission principals |
| All 7 Windows LAPS GPOs | Decryptor configuration (GPO existence only, not links) |
| Windows LAPS schema extension (`ms-LAPS-Password` attribute class) | Schema gate — **tool stops with a friendly error if absent; it never extends the schema itself** |

Missing OUs or groups produce a **Dependency Errors** listing and halt the plan. Missing GPOs are flagged per entry.

### 10.1 Plan Windows LAPS ACL Deployment
Review what delegations will be applied:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- 7 target OUs listed with their read/reset group assignments
- 6 `ConfigureLapsDecryptor` actions showing GPO name → decryptor principal
- Domain Controllers OU shows Self + Read/Reset for Domain Admins (no decryptor — DSRM always uses Domain Admins)
- No changes applied to Active Directory

### 10.2 Deploy Windows LAPS ACLs
Execute the Windows LAPS ACL deployment:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

**Expected Output:**
- 7 × Self-permission, Read-permission, Reset-permission delegations applied
- 6 GPOs configured with `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` (NETBIOS\sAMAccountName format)
- Deployment is idempotent — re-runs skip already-configured delegations and decryptor entries
- Deployment summary

### 10.3 Audit Windows LAPS ACLs
Verify Windows LAPS ACL and decryptor compliance:

```powershell
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- All 7 LAPS ACL delegations compliant (Self, Read, Reset present on each OU)
- All 6 GPO decryptor values compliant (correct `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` set)
- No drift detected
- Findings show `Compliant` for each delegation entry

> **Note on tier isolation:** `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` is a single principal per GPO. This means Tier 0 Admins can decrypt Tier 0 PAW passwords, but **cannot** decrypt Tier 1 or Tier 2 PAW passwords — each tier's admins decrypt only their own tier. This is intentional per-tier isolation enforced by CNG-DPAPI; GenericAll on a lower-tier PAW OU does not grant decryption.

## Deploying Windows LAPS as Part of Full Deployment

`-IncludeWinLaps` composes cleanly with `-FullDeployment`. The Windows LAPS phase runs **after** MSA → gMSA → dMSA (Phase 10):

```powershell
# Plan full deployment including Windows LAPS
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com

# Apply full deployment including Windows LAPS
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply

# Audit everything including Windows LAPS
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

> **Opt-in:** A plain `-FullDeployment` (without `-IncludeWinLaps`) does **not** deploy or audit Windows LAPS. You must explicitly add `-IncludeWinLaps` to include it.

---



After completing all deployment steps, run a comprehensive audit to ensure the entire Tier Model is compliant:

```powershell
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- All components compliant across all categories
- Zero high-severity findings
- Complete audit report

## Troubleshooting

### Component Dependencies

If a deployment step fails, verify dependencies are in place:
- **Groups** require OUs to exist
- **Users** require OUs and Groups to exist
- **OU ACLs** require OUs and Groups to exist
- **MSA ACLs** (Optional) require MSA objects and Groups to exist
- **gMSA ACLs** (Optional) require gMSA objects and Groups to exist
- **dMSA ACLs** (Optional) require dMSA objects and Groups to exist
- **Windows LAPS ACLs** (Optional) require OUs, Groups, and all 7 Windows LAPS GPOs to exist; Windows LAPS schema extension (`ms-LAPS-Password`) must be present
- **GPOs** require OUs to exist for linking

### Redeployment

If issues occur, you can safely re-run any deployment step. The deployment scripts are idempotent and will skip existing objects:

```powershell
# Re-run a specific component deployment
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -GroupOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

### Audit Failures

If an audit step reports drift or non-compliance:
1. Review the audit findings
2. Identify the specific discrepancies
3. Re-run the deployment for that component to remediate
4. Re-audit to verify compliance

## When to Use This Approach

Use this detailed step-by-step approach when:
- Deploying to production for the first time
- Validating each component before proceeding
- Troubleshooting specific component issues
- Learning the deployment process
- Meeting change control requirements for incremental changes

For routine deployments or updates, consider using the [Quick Deployment Guide](quick-deployment-guide.md) with `-FullDeployment`.

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
- Schedule regular audits to detect configuration drift
- Document any manual changes made outside automation
- Review audit reports periodically for compliance monitoring
