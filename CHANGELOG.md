## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **English-language enforcement (#23)**: `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` now fails fast — before any deployment or audit change — when the environment is not English (`en-US`). Two unconditional checks run up front and are inherited by both `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` and `Audit-TierModel.ps1`:
  - **Host operating system** — reads the local machine's static `InstallLanguage` LCID (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Language`) and requires an English variant (primary language `0x09`, e.g. en-US/en-GB). Runs after the elevation check and **before** the Pester/module checks, and returns immediately on a non-English host so the operator is never asked to install modules on an unsupported OS.
  - **Active Directory** — resolves three well-known groups by SID (Domain Admins `<DomainSID>-512`, Server Operators `S-1-5-32-549`, Account Operators `S-1-5-32-548`) and requires each directory `Name` to be its English value. Child-domain safe (no Enterprise/Schema Admins); names are read from AD (never client-side SID translation, which the local OS would localize into a false pass). A confirmed localized name always fails closed even if another well-known group cannot be resolved.
  - Both checks emit friendly `Errors`/`Remediation` and record diagnostics in `EnvironmentSnapshot` (`HostInstallLanguage`, `HostOsEnglish`, `AdLanguageEnglish`, `AdLanguageMismatches`, …).
- **Documentation**: new `docs/language-support.md` documenting the English-only requirement, the 18 fully-localized Windows Server languages that are detected and stopped, and a future community-localization roadmap. Prerequisite notes added to the README, the quick/detailed deployment guides, and the FAQ.

### Notes
- No configuration changes are required and English (`en-US`) deployments and audits are unaffected (full suite: **1,435** automated tests passing; module scope ~91% coverage). Non-English environments are a documented, unsupported scenario — see `docs/language-support.md`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **OU and GPO ACLs now bind to the preferred DC (BUG-001)**: `New-TierModelOuAcl` bound to the target OU with a serverless path (`[ADSI]"LDAP://$targetOUPath"`), which connects to a random DC — in multi-DC environments successive ACL delegations could land on different DCs, causing replication-dependent inconsistency. It now binds via `"LDAP://$DomainController/$targetOUPath"` (the `-PreferredDc` passed through the pipeline), matching the MSA/gMSA/dMSA ACL cmdlets. The same serverless-bind pattern in `New-TierModelGpo` (the GPO Deny-Apply ACL / GPC bind) was fixed to `"LDAP://$DomainController/CN={...}"` so every ACL — OU and GPO — targets the same DC.
- **`-UserOnly` output now aligns with `-GroupOnly` (BUG-002)**: running `Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -UserOnly` against a domain without the Tier Model OUs/Groups now shows the same sections as every other scope parameter — `Analyzing User requirements...`, a `User Plan Summary`, and the specific `Dependency Errors:` list (each missing OU/Group) — with the `=== Deployment Plan ===` section showing only the generic "Resolve all dependency errors" line. Previously `-UserOnly` called `Invoke-UserDeployment -Silent`, which hid the summary and the dependency-error listing (only the generic resolve line appeared under an otherwise empty heading). The fix runs `Invoke-UserDeployment` non-Silent like `-GroupOnly`, while suppressing per-user "User exists" noise via `Get-TierModelUser -Silent` for parity with the Group path.
- **Windows LAPS FullDeployment planning no longer shows red "missing GPO" errors (BUG-005)**: during `-FullDeployment ... -IncludeWinLaps` preview (without `-ConfirmApply`) against an unprepared domain, a missing LAPS GPO is now silently non-blocking (the GPO is created by the earlier GPO phase). Instead of red `Required GPO ... does not exist` errors, the plan lists each LAPS GPO that will be configured as a yellow `■ Configure : <gpoName>` action, matching the format of the other planned actions. Only the 6 decryptor-configured GPOs are listed; the DC LAPS GPO retains the DSRM default (Domain Admins) by design and is not decryptor-configured in this phase. The FD planner's group resolution was also fixed so that, against an unprepared domain (where `Get-ADGroup -Filter` returns no match without throwing), the `Create ACL` principals and the decryptor `Configure` actions render with best-effort estimated names instead of being blank/omitted (resolved for real at apply time). The standalone `-IncludeWinLaps` path keeps the strict GPO pre-existence requirement (earlier phases do not run there).
- **Pester version gate loosened to any 5.x, with side-by-side 6.x support (BUG-007)**: CI and `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` previously pinned Pester to the exact reference version (`5.7.1`), which blocked otherwise-valid 5.x releases from running or deploying. The gate now accepts any Pester **5.x** release (major-version match) while still blocking **6.x**, whose breaking changes (new mock engine / `Should-*` assertions) broke 44 test cases.
  - CI installs Pester with `-MinimumVersion 5.0.0 -MaximumVersion 5.99.99`; `config/dependencies.json` keeps `5.7.1` as the tested reference version.
  - `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` now accepts a supported 5.x release even when an unsupported newer major (e.g. 6.x) is installed **side-by-side** — this does not block deployment. It emits a non-blocking note that PowerShell auto-loads the highest version, so the 5.x line must be imported explicitly (`Import-Module Pester -MaximumVersion 5.99.99`). It fails only when no 5.x release is present.
  - `tests/Invoke-AllTests.ps1` now selects and explicitly imports the highest installed Pester 5.x so local/lab test runs use the supported version even when 6.x is installed alongside it.
- **dMSA/gMSA/Windows LAPS prerequisites now fail fast, before any deployment phase (BUG-003)**: previously `-FullDeployment -IncludeDmsa` on a domain below Domain Functional Level 2025 ran the entire standard deployment and only surfaced the dMSA requirement as a confusing `attribute 'msDS-DelegatedManagedServiceAccount' not found in schema` planner error at Phase 9. A dMSA DFL critical pre-flight gate now fails fast with a clean message right after module load, and the `-Include*` switches are routed through the up-front `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` call so gMSA (KDS root key), Windows LAPS (schema), and dMSA prerequisites all block before any phase in both `-FullDeployment` and standalone modes. The dMSA DFL message is friendly (no redundant schema-version error), and the DFL-only check is confirmed correct for the single-domain Tier Model (Forest FL 2025 is required only for cross-domain/cross-forest dMSA, which the Tier Model never performs).
- **Windows LAPS audit now detects unexpected (extra) LAPS delegations (BUG-004)**: `Test-TierModelWinLapsAcl` documented an `UnexpectedAcl` finding but never emitted one — it only verified that the configured Read/Reset principals were present, never that extra principals were absent. It now flags any LAPS extended-right holder that is not a configured Read/Reset group and not a well-known/admin principal as `UnexpectedAcl` (yellow ⚠️, counted as drift), mirroring the MSA/gMSA/dMSA audits.
- **`-Include*` prerequisite checks resolve `config/dependencies.json` from any working directory (BUG-008)**: the `$prereqSplat` hashtables for the MSA/gMSA/dMSA/WinLaps prerequisite checks omitted `DependenciesPath`, so `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` fell back to its cwd-relative default and failed with "Dependencies file not found" when the script was launched by absolute path from a different directory. Both splats now pass an absolute `$PSScriptRoot`-based `DependenciesPath`, matching the primary prerequisite call.
- **Consistent fail-fast prerequisite messages across Deploy and Audit**: a shared `Write-TierModelFailFast` helper renders every up-front gate (PowerShell version, dMSA DFL, and the general prerequisite failure) identically — indented message with no `Prerequisites not met:` header and no `ERROR:` prefix, a blank-line-separated `Remediation steps:` block, and the closing `Deploy script completed.` / `Audit script completed.` line. Duplicated resolution text was removed from the Windows LAPS schema errors, every previously-bare dMSA prerequisite error gained a remediation step, and `Audit-TierModel.ps1` gained a matching PowerShell-version gate.
- **OU "Block GPO Inheritance" is now verified and retried during deployment (BUG-010)**: creating an OU with `blockGpoInheritance` (or `disableInheritance`) previously called `Set-GPInheritance -IsBlocked Yes` (or `Set-Acl` protection) once and reported success as long as the call did not throw — but the change intermittently did not persist (a silent no-op, ~10% per OU on a fast run), leaving a tier boundary unblocked while the deployment still reported success. `New-TierModelOu` now reads back `Get-GPInheritance` (and the ACL's `AreAccessRulesProtected`) on the same DC and retries up to 4 times with backoff until the setting is verified; if it still cannot be confirmed it records a human-readable error ("Block GPO Inheritance flag was not set for OU 'X'…") instead of a false success. In `-FullDeployment`, an unverified OU inheritance setting hard-stops the run before the Groups phase so a tier boundary is never silently left open. The logic remains create-only — existing/live OUs are never modified (remediate drift via change control and confirm with the audit script).
- **Windows LAPS audit no longer false-flags tier admins that hold OU full control (BUG-009)**: `Test-TierModelWinLapsAcl`'s `UnexpectedAcl` detection (added in BUG-004) uses `Find-LapsADExtendedRights`, which resolves a principal's *effective* LAPS read — including access granted implicitly by `GenericAll` (full control). Because the Tier Model's own OU-management delegation grants tier admin groups (e.g. `Tier0Admins`/`Tier1Admins`) `GenericAll` on their Member-Server OUs, every audit flagged them as unexpected LAPS readers even though they hold no *explicit* ms-LAPS delegation. The audit now collects the OU's `GenericAll` (Allow) holders from the same DACL it already reads for SELF detection and excludes them from the unexpected-holder check, so a genuinely unexpected *explicit* LAPS reader is still flagged while `GenericAll`-derived effective access is not. Full-control drift remains covered separately by the OU ACL audit. (Lab-validated: the two recurring `Tier0Admins`/`Tier1Admins` warnings are gone and an injected explicit LAPS holder is still detected.)
- **Clean deployment no longer reports phantom "Skipped" items (BUG-011)**: a brand-new `-FullDeployment … -ConfirmApply` reported `Skipped: 4` despite creating everything with zero real skips. The User and OuAcl result objects built their `Applied`/`Skipped` arrays with `@(1..$executionResult.Skipped | ForEach-Object {…})`; when the count is `0`, PowerShell's `1..0` is a **descending** range (`{1, 0}`, two elements), so each of those two phases emitted 2 phantom "Skipped" entries → `Skipped: 4`. All four `1..$n` ranges (the User and OuAcl `Applied` and `Skipped` builders) are now guarded with `if ($n -gt 0)` so a zero count yields an empty array; real applied/skipped counts are unchanged.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

#### Windows LAPS Support
- **Windows LAPS ACL Cmdlets**: `Get-TierModelWinLapsAcl`, `Get-TierModelWinLapsAclFd`, `New-TierModelWinLapsAcl`, and `Test-TierModelWinLapsAcl` for deploying and auditing Windows LAPS DACL delegations (Self / Read / Reset permissions per target OU)
- **Windows LAPS Decryptor Audit**: `Test-TierModelWinLapsDecryptor` verifies the `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` GPO registry policy on each non-DC LAPS GPO
- **`-IncludeWinLaps` switch**: added to `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` (standalone and full-deployment Phase 10, after MSA/gMSA/dMSA) and `Audit-TierModel.ps1` (opt-in ACL + decryptor drift detection)
- **Configuration**: `config/tiermodel-winlaps.json` defining 7 LAPS ACL delegations plus per-OU decryptor group mapping
- **GPO Decryptor Configuration**: deployment configures the authorized password decryptor (`ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal`) on the 6 non-DC LAPS GPOs so the correct tier group can decrypt managed passwords (Domain Controllers retain the DSRM default of Domain Admins)
- **Prerequisite Validation**: extended `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` with the Windows LAPS schema hard-stop and the OU / group / LAPS-GPO dependency checks
- **Windows LAPS only**: uses `ms-LAPS-*` attributes exclusively — never legacy Microsoft LAPS (`ms-Mcs-AdmPwd*` / `AdmPwd.PS`)

### Changed
- Removed the superseded manual `optional/Deploy-WindowsLaps.ps1` (functionality replaced by `Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps`)

### Tests
- Added `tests/Unit.WinLapsAclOperations.Tests.ps1` and `tests/Integration.WinLapsDeployment.Tests.ps1` (113 new tests) and extended prerequisite/manifest tests; added AD/GPO/LAPS stubs so the suite runs in CI without a domain controller
- Full suite: 1,401 automated tests passing; 90.92% module code coverage

### Documentation
- Documented `-IncludeWinLaps` across `README.md` and `docs/` (detailed deployment guide, deployment methodology, cmdlet architecture, drift detection, FAQ, test coverage, test tag matrix), matching the existing MSA/gMSA/dMSA "Optional Feature" pattern

- **MSA ACL Cmdlets**: `Get-TierModelMsaAcl`, `Get-TierModelMsaAclFd`, `New-TierModelMsaAcl`, and `Test-TierModelMsaAcl` for standalone Managed Service Account ACLs
- **Configuration**: `config/tiermodel-gmsa.json`, `config/tiermodel-dmsa.json`, and `config/tiermodel-msa.json` for MSA tier model ACL definitions
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Extended `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` with MSA-related checks
- **Domain GUID Resolution**: Enhanced `Resolve-DomainSpecificGuid` to support MSA schema/extended-rights GUIDs
